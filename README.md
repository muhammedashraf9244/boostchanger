# Boost Changer
### Here you can find the old repo of this app in gitlab
https://gitlab.com/nbebaw/boostchanger

## :bangbang: This App is now only for Linux :bangbang:

### :heavy_exclamation_mark: This App needs root rights. When and why? :heavy_exclamation_mark:

Boost Changer is made to control the frequencies of Intel CPUs. It can also manage the processor's energy consumption through Energy-Performance Preference.

In generall this app does not need root rights but when you hit the Turn Off or On button a popup window will ask you about your root password.

#### why?

- In your Kernel there is a file called <code>/sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/no_turbo</code>.
> To turn off or on your turbo boost you have to change this file and that is what this app does.<br>

- In your Kernel there is a file called <code>/sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/max_perf_pct</code>.
> when you change the energy performance in Boost Changer you have to change this file and that is what this app does.

#### :pushpin: This app will only work on a real machine. :pushpin:

## What it isn't
This is just a GUI application and it is not meant to replace 
[TLP](https://linrunner.de/en/tlp/tlp.html), [powertop](https://01.org/powertop) or 
any other power management / energy consumption service. It is meant just to 
provide quick access to ``sysfs`` settings related to Intel Processors and 
in fact it can run on top of TLP.
